# Cycle
---
Cycle is a game where two players try to cut each other off using cycles (@) 
that leave a trail behind them. Each player tries to be the first cycle to
run into the other players trail. When one succeeds, is "game over".

## Game Controls
---
Cycle one (green cycle) will use "a" key to move left, "d" to move right, "w" to move up, and "s" to move down.

Cycle two (red cycle) will use "j" key to move left, "l" to move right, "i" to move up, and "k" to move down.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 cycle 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- cycle              (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
